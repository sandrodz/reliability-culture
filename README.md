# 🧭 Introducing "Days Without Incident"  
### A Culture of Reliability, One Day at a Time

We are committed to building stable, trustworthy, and resilient solutions. In a world where reliability is everything, every day without an incident is a win — not just for our customers, but for all of us.

We’re excited to introduce a new initiative:

> **✅ Days Without Incident**

This is a simple, visible, and powerful way to track and celebrate our success in delivering high-quality, incident-free service — together.

---

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?

The purpose of this initiative is *not* to create fear of failure. Instead, we want to encourage a shared culture of **care**, **quality**, and **accountability** across teams.

Every day we go without an incident is a symbol of operational excellence — and it belongs to *everyone*.

---

## 🔍 What Counts as an “Incident”?

For this initiative, an **incident** is any production event that:

- Causes **customer-visible service degradation or downtime**
- Requires an **emergency fix or rollback**
- Results in a **security breach or data leak**
- Triggers a **Severity 1 or 2** alert
- Requires a **postmortem**

> _Note: Minor bugs or issues caught before release do **not** count._

---

## ⏱ How the Counter Works

We will maintain a live counter that shows:

- ✅ **Days since the last incident**
- 📅 **Date of the last incident**
- 🏆 **Record streak (longest time without incident)**

It will be automatically updated **daily** via Slack.

When an incident occurs:

- The counter resets to **0**
- A Slack message is posted with the **date and a brief summary**
- A link to the **postmortem** is shared for transparency and learning

---

## 🎮 Gamification: Making Reliability a Shared Game

To make this more fun and motivating, we’re adding gamification:

### 🟢 Milestone Celebrations

| Milestone | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| 10 Days  | Team shoutout in Slack |
| 30 Days  | Virtual coffee vouchers ☕ |
| 50 Days  | Team lunch 🎉 |
| 100+ Days | Custom swag or surprise 🎁 |

### 🥇 Record Tracking
We'll track and celebrate the **longest streak** ever achieved by the company.

---

## 👥 Team Participation

Every team contributes to the streak:
- Write safe, well-tested code
- Practice thoughtful deployment
- Learn from incidents and share takeaways
- Collaborate to prevent regressions

Reliability is a team sport — and the streak reflects all of us.

---

## 🛠 Slack Integration

- A Slack bot will post the counter **daily**

---

## 🤝 Why This Matters

Incidents are part of software — they’re not shameful. But every day without one is worth celebrating.

This initiative is about visibility, learning, and **shared ownership of system reliability**.

> Let’s treat every new day as a chance to keep this counter alive — not for the number, but for what it represents.
